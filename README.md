## Background & Business Problem

Briefly introduce the business, industry, or context.
Describe the challenge(s) faced.
- Example: "The company noticed a decline in customer retention and wanted to identify churn drivers."

## Project Objectives

Clearly state the goals of the project.
- What questions are you trying to answer?
- What metrics are you focusing on?
- Example: "Analyze customer data to identify factors influencing churn and recommend actions to reduce churn rate."

## Data Collection & Understanding

Describe how the data was collected.
Summarize the datasets used (sources, dimensions, time period).
Provide a data dictionary (columns and meaning).
- Example: "We analyzed transaction records, customer profiles, and service interactions from Jan 2022 to Oct 2024."

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Outline the steps for cleaning the data—missing values, outliers, formatting.
Document key transformations and feature engineering.
- Example: "Removed records with missing age, imputed missing values in 'income', and created new variable 'engagement_score'."

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Present summary statistics and initial visualizations.
Highlight notable patterns, anomalies, or trends.
Narrate the discovery process—what did you observe and how did it guide the analysis?
- Example: "We found a strong correlation between low engagement scores and churn."

## Analysis Procedures & Methodology

Explain analytical techniques used (e.g., regression, clustering).
Justify why you chose particular methods.
Provide code snippets or workflow diagrams as needed.
- Example: "Used logistic regression to quantify churn risk and k-means clustering to segment customers."

## Key Findings & Insights

Storytelling: Guide the reader through your main discoveries.
Visualize findings (graphs, charts).
Interpret what the results mean for the business problem.
- Example: "Customers with low engagement and high support tickets are 3x more likely to churn."

## Solutions & Recommendations

Based on insights, propose actions.
Quantify expected impact if possible.
- Example: "Launching a loyalty program for at-risk segments could reduce churn by 15%."

## Limitations & Assumptions

Acknowledge caveats in your approach (data gaps, assumptions).
Suggest improvements for future analyses.

## How to Reproduce

Step-by-step instructions for running the analysis:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the environment (list dependencies).
3. Run the data pipeline and scripts.
4. View results and notebooks.
